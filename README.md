An simulation of UAV based on LQR control, run Linearmodel.m, then NlinCloopintcontrol.slx and check the result in scopes. Run visualize.m for staric trajectory result.


A maximum output of actuators is set, which makes the initial error large and dcrease relatively slow. Please set the maximum  value larger to reduce the error.
